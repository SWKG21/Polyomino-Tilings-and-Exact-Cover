# Polyomino-Tilings-and-Exact-Cover

This is the project of course "Conception and analyse of algorithms" at École Polytechnique.
It is realized in Java by Wang SUN and Julien LÂASRI.

Main steps:
• Generate all polyominoes of specific sizes.
• Create data structure using the dancing-link algorithm.
• Exactly cover areas of specific shapes and sizes using polyominoes with specific conditions.

Files:
• result/ contains some results in .png format.
• src/ contains all source code.
• PolyominoINF421.txt contains the explanation of all important functions is in the file.
• report.pdf is the final report of this project.
